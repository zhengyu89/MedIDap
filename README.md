## I. Project Overview
MedIDap is a unified, portable medical identity ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between physical paper records and a digital future. It ensures that patient data is accessible, secure, and portable, empowering both patients and healthcare providers.

## II. Problem Landscape & Statistics

### Current Healthcare Infrastructure Status (Malaysia Context)

**Public Sector:**
*   **99.9%** of public clinics are paper-based.
*   **85.3%** of public hospitals are paper-based.
*   Only **14.7%** of public hospitals have adopted Electronic Medical Records (EMR).

**Private Sector:**
*   **75.2%** of private hospitals use vendor-specific EMR systems.
*   **24.8%** of private hospitals remain paper-based.

### Patient Health Trends
There is a rising prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) correlated with age, increasing steadily from the 18-29 age group up to the 60+ age group.
*(Source: National Health & Morbidity Survey 2023)*

### Core Issues Identified
*   **The Digital Divide:** Patient risk is currently unmanaged by existing infrastructure.
*   **Chronic Disease Management:** High rates of non-adherence to follow-up appointments.
*   **Data Integrity:** Frequent medication history discrepancies.

---

## III. Problem Statement: High Risk, Low Digital Access

*   **Inefficient Processes:** Medical staff spend excessive time searching through scattered paper records.

*   **Patient Burden & Data Inaccuracy:**
    *   Patients are forced to repeat complex health histories at every visit.
    *   Relying on patient memory and paper leads to missing or inaccurate records.

*   **Medication Errors:** Doctors often lack knowledge of a patient's actual allergies or current medications, which can cause errors and put lives at risk.

## IV. The Solution: MedIDap

### Product Concept
**Description:** An all-in-one portable health record where health information is available at the user's fingertips.

### Physical Interface
*   **NFC Smart Card:** A "Universal Health MedIDap" card containing Name, ID, and Blood Type.
*   **Dynamic QR:** Users can scan a QR code to view medical information or regenerate the QR for security.

### Key Features
*   **AI Vision & OCR:** Scans physical prescriptions using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
*   **Universal Access:** User and family views are available anywhere.
*   **Medical History Import:** Immediately views chronic conditions, allergies, and past labs.
*   **Data Processing:** Extracts medical data, imports it, and converts it to standardized FHIR JSON format to update the User ID.
*   **Guardian Control:**
    *   Allows management of support for dependents (e.g., OKU support).
    *   Enables guardian access for emergency support.
    *   Lists active guardians with contact details and relationship (e.g., Daughter, Son).

## V. Value Proposition: Why MedIDap?

*   **Increased Organizational Efficiency:** Provides instant access to complete digital patient profiles, eliminating paper file searches, speeding up workflows, and reducing errors.
*   **Convenience for Every Patient:** One ID carries all medical history (reports/documents) and follows the patient anywhere, including rural areas or overseas.
*   **Inclusive & Error-Free Reporting:** Addresses the issue of patients (especially the elderly) forgetting history; ensures accurate data to prevent medication errors.
*   **Improved Guidance & Long-Term Care:** Connects patients with family/guardians to ensure better support for chronic care and follow-ups.

### Workflow

1.  **Input:** Doctors/Nurses upload or type data into the **Hospital Panel (Web)**.
2.  **Processing:**
    *   An **OCR & AI Processor** converts the input.
    *   **Core Technology:** The system is powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.
    *   **Standardization:** Data is converted into **FHIR R4 JSON** format.
3.  **Storage:** Data is written to and stored on a **Decentralized Ledger (Smart ID Ledger)**.
4.  **Access:**
    *   **Patient:** Uses an **NFC Smart Card** or **QR Smart Health Pass**.
5.  **Sync:** Supports online sync and offline data exchange.

## X. Getting Started (Development)

To run the entire ecosystem locally:

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   Google Gemini API Key

### 1. Setup Hospital Panel
```bash
cd Hospital_Panel
npm install
